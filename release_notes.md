# Relase Notes

#### 0.8.1 - 24 Jan 2016
 - corrected a bug for Orbitrap related to offsetfreq.

#### 0.8.0 - 23 Jan 2016
  - first clean version using the new HDF5 file set-up  **WARNING** 
    - HDF5 files created with this version cannot be read with previous versions
    - HDF5 files created with previous versions cannot be read with this version - this should be fixed later -
      File now contains acquisition parameters files in the attached hdf5 sub-group
  - datasets now carry store and retrieve the parmeters imported from manufacturers file in d.params
  - improved FTMS calibration using 1, 2, and 3 parameters calibration : calibA calibB calibC, retrieve by Import from experimental file
  - improved FTMS Hz unit, added the d.axis.offsetfreq parameter
  - corrected fine details of F1 demodulation and added the parameter freq_f1demodu
  - unittests extended, in particular in visu2D
  - Starting with this version
    - a stable version will be maintained, downloadable as a zip file in the download page
  https://bitbucket.org/delsuc/spike/downloads
    - Two developpement branches will be used, the `default` for the stable version - improved for bugs, and the `devel` branche, used for developping the new features.

#### 0.7.1 - 5 Jan 2016
  - greatly improved internal compression of msh5 files and speed of processing.py
  - many small corrections and bug fixes.

#### 0.7.0 - November 2015
  - a plugin mechanism has been created which allows to add very simply new features to the program
      - most new features are implemented through this mechanism
  - the organisation of the spectral axes has been complete modified, with the introduction of a Unit class
      - each axis holds its own series of possible units (called .units)
      - and the current unit used for display and selection
      - many commands now have a zoom= ketword that works in the current unit
      - additionnaly, there are itoc and ctoi unit converters
  - Thanks to this, NMR data-sets are now correctly handled, DOSY are still in progress and should come soon
      - addtionnaly a plugin for Bruker NMR processing is now implemented
  - A complete 1D and 2D peak-picker is now implemented, with many controls and features
  - New baseline correction algo have been implemented
  - the sane algorithm, which is an evolution from urQrd has been separated from urQRd, so both algo can now be used independently
  - Tests have been reorganized and improved
  - Importers have been extended - parameters are now brought back to the user
  - many others

#### 0.6.4 - march 2015
  - added Bruker NMR import
  - clean-up of the module, still going on
  - Tests improved

#### 0.6.3 - march 2015
  - first installeable release

#### 0.6.0 - dec 2014
  - Fork to SPIKE
  - Large improvements of the display program, renamed visu2D
  - Corrected a bug in the hypercomplex modulus, resulting in splitting in 2D-FT-ICR
  - many improvements everywhere

#### 0.5.1 - 26 mar 2014
  - processing2.py renamed to processing.py   with added features
      - urQRd
  - source code reorganized by folders

#### 0.5.0 - 24 mar 2014
  - starting new devl effort
  - published ! version of urQRd

#### 0.4.1 - 27 Sep 2012
  - final (?) version of urQRd
  - added data arithmetic
  - many other optimisation

#### 0.4.0 - 20 apr 2012 -
new version processing2.py (temporary name)  this one

  - processing is performed in steps, F2 from infile to interfile (intermediate file) and F1 from interfile to outfile
  - steps are optionnal, F2 or F1 can be performed alone - allowing denoising on the interfile
  - processing is faster and mpi enabled - speed-up are better for very large files
  - has a better way of computing the smaller spectra - done by downsampling - faster and nicer
  - vignette is now 1024x1024 - can be changed using SIZEMIN in config file

#### 0.3.11 - 29 mar 2012
Small tools have been added to modify configuration files and to mix processing.py and ipython visualisation
#### 0.3.10 - 22 jan  2012
processing is now (hopefully) bug free and RAPID !
#### 0.3.9 - 18 jan  2012
fticrvisu.py, processing working, getting all parameters correctly from FTICRData and Apex
#### 0.3.8 - 13 jan  2012
fticrvisu.py, processing working, corrected after Marie came
#### 0.3.7 - 12 dec  2011
correction of Gifa file bug, bug in Apex for narrow band data-sets, changes in msh5 file format
#### 0.3.6
3 Oct  2011 - added  HDF5 file format (.msh5), multiresolution files, configuration files (.mscf), fticrvisu
#### 0.3.5
5 Sept 2011 - added  cadzow in MPI / savitsky-golay / HDF5 still in progress
#### 0.3.4
26 July 2011 - added  autotests / savehdf5 first version
#### 0.3.3
12 July 2011 - first reliable/taged  FTICR version
