"""
Plug-ins for the Spike package

All the plugin files located in spike/plugins folder the loaded automatically 
when import importing spike the first time.

the variable spike.plugins.plugins contains the lsit of the loaded plugin modules.

It is allways possible to load a plugin afterward by import a plugin definition at a later time during run-time.

Each plugin file should define the needed functions :

def myfunc(npkdata, args):
    "myfunc doc"
    ...do whatever, assuming npkdata is a NPKData
    return npkdata     # THIS is important, that is the standard NPKData mechanism

and register them into NPKData as follows :
NPKData_plugin("myname", myfunc)

then, any NPKData will inherit the myname() method

For the moment, only NPKData plugins are handled.
